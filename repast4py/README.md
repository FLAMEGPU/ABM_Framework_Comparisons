# pyFLAMEGPU ABM Comparison Benchmarks

This directory contains the implementation of several ABMs used to compare agent based models, including:

+ `flocking` - a 2D spatial implementation of boids flocking model
+ `schelling` - an implementation of Schelling's Model of Segregation

The [`repast4py` package](https://repast.github.io/repast4py.site/index.html) must be available within the Python environment used to launch the independent models or `benchmark.py`.
